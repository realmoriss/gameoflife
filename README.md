# Game of Life

This is a game based on Conway's Game of Life.
It should work on all platforms, though I only tested it on Windows 10 x64 with MinGW compiler.
Please note that this is not a big project, it was written as a homework for my C programming course.
The project is not under active development, however I will try to make additions whenever I have time for it.
Feel free to report any bugs, I will try to maintain this game usable.
